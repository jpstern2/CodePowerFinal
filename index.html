IV. The Why
Informative Aspect:
Accessible web development is essential for creating an inclusive digital environment. For many users, particularly those with disabilities, an inaccessible website can be a significant barrier to engaging with content. In the context of museums, this means that valuable educational and cultural resources may be out of reach for a significant portion of the population. By implementing accessible web development practices, the Wisconsin Maritime Museum can ensure that all users, regardless of ability, can access and interact with its online content. This not only aligns with legal standards but also fulfills the museum’s mission to educate and engage a diverse audience.
Persuasive Aspect:
Adopting accessible web development practices will position the museum as a leader in inclusivity and digital accessibility. This leadership role can enhance the museum’s reputation, attract more visitors, and potentially open up new opportunities for partnerships and funding. Moreover, an accessible website can improve overall visitor satisfaction, leading to increased engagement and repeat visits. A study by the Nielsen Norman Group found that accessible websites often provide a better user experience for all users, not just those with disabilities. By making accessibility a priority, the museum can ensure that it provides the best possible experience for every visitor.
Case Study:
Consider the example of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, which implemented a comprehensive accessibility initiative for its digital content. The museum’s website now includes features such as audio descriptions, keyboard navigation, and alternative text for images. As a result, the Smithsonian saw a significant increase in engagement from users with disabilities, as well as positive feedback from all user groups. This case demonstrates the tangible benefits of prioritizing accessibility in web development.
V. Code And Power
Identification of Biases:
Biases in web development can manifest in various ways, from the choice of content to the design of user interfaces. At the Wisconsin Maritime Museum, potential biases might include the prioritization of certain historical narratives over others or the presentation of data in ways that are inaccessible to some users. For example, non-semantic HTML elements can create barriers for screen reader users, while certain data visualizations might inadvertently emphasize information that aligns with the museum’s institutional perspective, potentially marginalizing alternative narratives.
Impact on Stakeholders:
These biases can disproportionately affect users with disabilities, preventing them from fully engaging with the museum’s digital content. For instance, if a data visualization is not accessible to screen readers, users with visual impairments may be unable to access critical information. Similarly, if the website prioritizes certain narratives, it may alienate users who are interested in exploring different aspects of maritime history. This can lead to exclusion and marginalization, undermining the museum’s mission to provide an inclusive and educational experience for all.
Theoretical Considerations:
From a theoretical standpoint, biases in web development reflect broader societal inequities. Critical theory, particularly the work of scholars like Michel Foucault, emphasizes the ways in which power dynamics shape knowledge production and dissemination. In the context of the Wisconsin Maritime Museum, this means that the design and content of the website must be carefully considered to avoid reinforcing existing power structures and to promote equity and inclusion. This involves not only making the website accessible but also ensuring that the content is representative of diverse perspectives and that all users have the opportunity to engage with the museum’s digital offerings.
VI. Ethical Web Development Strategies
Bias Mitigation:
To mitigate biases, the website will adhere to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA standards. This includes using semantic HTML, providing text alternatives for non-text content, and ensuring keyboard accessibility. Additionally, the museum will engage in inclusive design practices, such as conducting stakeholder consultations and usability testing with diverse user groups. These practices will help identify potential biases and ensure that the website meets the needs of all users.
Accessibility Testing:
Accessibility testing will be an ongoing process throughout the website’s development. Tools such as Axe Accessibility Checker and WAVE will be used to identify and rectify accessibility issues. These tools provide detailed reports on potential problems, such as missing alt text or insufficient color contrast, allowing the development team to make necessary adjustments. Additionally, the museum will conduct user testing with individuals who have disabilities, ensuring that the website is truly accessible in real-world scenarios.
Ongoing Accessibility Monitoring:
Once the website is live, ongoing monitoring will be essential to maintain accessibility. This will include regular audits using automated tools, as well as user feedback mechanisms that allow visitors to report accessibility issues. The museum will also commit to periodic updates to ensure that the website continues to meet the latest accessibility standards and best practices.
VII. The Space between the Code
User Experience (UX) Considerations:
User experience (UX) is closely intertwined with accessibility. A well-designed website not only meets accessibility standards but also provides an intuitive and enjoyable experience for all users. To achieve this, the website will incorporate UX design principles such as simplicity, consistency, and user control. For example, the navigation will be designed to be easy to understand and use, with clear labels and logical groupings of content. Additionally, the website will include features such as adjustable font sizes and color contrast settings, allowing users to customize the interface to their needs.
Wireframes and Mockups:
To illustrate these UX principles, the following wireframes provide a visual representation of key pages on the website:
Home Page:
Features a simple, clean layout with a prominent search bar and easy access to main sections such as exhibits, research, and education.
